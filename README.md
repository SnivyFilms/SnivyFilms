## Salutations

I am an American Computer Science Student.

I code whatever I feel like whenever I feel like it, as of typing this GitHub readme which is making plugins for SCP SL.

Other things I do is photography, occasional recordings, and a fair amount of gaming.

Languages that I know: C#, Java, Python, C, C++, JavaScript. There's probs something I am missing, I'll update when I remember haha

Snakes are so cool
